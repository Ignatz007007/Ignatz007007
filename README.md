Yo! My name is Ignacy, though Igantz sounds better in english, doesn't it?

I am currently studying programming at my High School, though I am considering switching to pursue something more biology-oriented instead.
I'd prefer a mix of both, we'll see where that takes me.

I have an interest in video games and 3D modelling.

Right now I'm focusing on studying python, though I also know the basic front-end trifecta and PHP.

I can speak these languages:

ğŸ‡µğŸ‡± (native)
ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· (spent some time there)
ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ (my favorite)
